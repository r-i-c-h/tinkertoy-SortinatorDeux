# tinkertoy-SortinatorDeux
Tinker Toy Futzing Proj for Tim+John

Create a tiny full-stack Node app to sort characters in a given string.

## Specification
On the client, create a form that's centered vertically and horizontally in the page.   
This form accepts a string and submits it to the server.   
On the server, the string is sorted lexicographically in descending order.   
Back on the client, display a table of each submitted string and its sorted version.   

## Other requirements
Your logic should have a few simple unit tests. Please use Jest.   
The UI should not look like complete crap. Demonstrate some basic CSS ability and a bit of design sense to style the form pleasantly.   

## Logistics
Create a repo from scratch. 
Make a series of sensible, well-named commits.
Submit your repo URL.
